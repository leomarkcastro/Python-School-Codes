# Python-School-Codes

These codes are written in Python 2.7 in my 2nd Year College at BSU CpE coursse.

I'll try to identify each codes.

<Note, they are independent of one another>

* Book of Luck - this is a series of list, tuple, dictionary operation with user interaction

* Escape - A hidden number is generated every iteration, if you guess it if it is odd or even correctly thrice, then you can break out of the loop

* Trigono - It will ask for three variables (a,b,c) and will use all this three for the sqrt(a^2+b^2) pythagorean theorem

* Rela Prob - Will ask for two numbers (a and b) then check them in x, +, -, >=, <=, ==, ^, &, |, += -= and *=

* How Many - It will ask for the length of your text, then it will ask for the actual text, if your previous length input matches the length of your actual text input, it will calculate the amount of letters, numbers and symbols in the input string
